*The source console being used in my game Galactic Lander*

SourceConsole is an in-game developer console asset for Unity.
It's designed to be compatible with pretty much any sort of game, and most importantly, is designed based on the classic Source engine console.

## Installation

First, copy the C# scripts from the ['Scripts'](https://github.com/ZeroByter/SourceConsole/tree/master/Assets/SourceConsole/Scripts) folder.

Then, open the 'Just The Console - For Copying' scene and copy the console and paste it in the scene that is first loaded in your game. The console is persistent, and will stick around no matter how many scenes you change.

## Requirements

Keep in mind, TextMeshPro is required for the console UI to work. TMPro is *not* included in the release asset package.

## Examples

There are examples available on how to utilize the console in the 'Examples' folder.

## Why?

I used to/still do play a lot of Source engine games, such as Garry's Mod and CS:GO. While developing games on Unity I found myself missing the Source engine console and it's usefulness.

I found myself commonly binding all sorts of development functions to obscure keys only I knew about in the hope players won't discover them accidentally; until finally I realized I needed a proper solution.

## Other developer consoles

Of course, there are plenty of other developer consoles out there on the Unity asset store, but none of them quite appealed to me, and so I came up with the idea to copy off the Source engine's console.
